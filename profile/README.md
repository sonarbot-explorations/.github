# Welcome to SonatBot Explorations - hydrographic surveys with maximum precision and efficiency!


Founded in 2023, SonarBot Services GmbH is a professional bythymetric scanning service for everyone from hobby diver to hydraulic engineer.

With our autonomous USVs (unmanned surface vehicles) we scan underwater topographies and provide high-resolution 3D models as SonarMaps and bathymetric data in DGNSS/RTK quality.

## SonarBot

Our USVs (unmanned surface vehicles) are autonomous scan rovers with centimeter-precise real-time positioning. They navigate independently and reliably even in adverse conditions and poor visibility. Mission monitoring can be conducted from any location using innovative cloud relay technology.

SonarBots can be equipped with various sonar modules and sensors depending on the purpose of deployment.

## SonarMaps

Our SonarMaps are detailed 3D renditions of scanned underwater topographies. Dive virtually into the water in real-time or explore beneath the entire surface from the shore. With free positioning in the model, you can enjoy any desired perspective. Experience a 360Â° panoramic view from any chosen position.

## SonarApp


The SonarApp is a free mobile viewer of the SonarMaps. This way you can have all publicly available maps with you at any time and place! You can choose perspectives with intuitive touch navigation, measure distances, set waypoints or determine bearings. It is available for iPhone, iPad and in the Apple-Store!
