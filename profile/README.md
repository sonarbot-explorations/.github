# Welcome to SonarBot Explorations

## Hydrographic Surveys with Precision and Efficiency

Founded in 2023, SonarBot Exploration Services GmbH provides professional bathymetric scanning services for everyone from hobby scuba diver to hydraulic engineer.

With our autonomous USVs (unmanned surface vehicles) we scan underwater topographies and provide high-resolution 3D models ("SonarMaps") and bathymetric data exports in DGNSS/RTK quality.

## SonarBots

Our "SonarBot" USVs (unmanned surface vehicles) are autonomous scan rovers with centimeter-precise real-time positioning. They navigate independently and reliably even in adverse conditions and poor visibility. Mission monitoring can be conducted from any location using innovative cloud relay technology.

SonarBots can be equipped with different sonar modules and other sensors depending on specific use case.

## SonarMaps

Our SonarMaps are detailed 3D models of scanned underwater topography that can be interactively visualized. Virtually dive into the water in real-time or explore beneath the surface from the shore. With free positioning and orientation inside the model you can enjoy any desired perspective. Experience a 360Â° panoramic view from any chosen position.

## SonarApp

The SonarApp is a free mobile viewer for SonarMaps. This way you can have all publicly available SonarMaps with you at any time and place! You can choose perspectives with intuitive touch navigation, measure distances, set waypoints or determine bearings. It is available for iPhone and iPad.
